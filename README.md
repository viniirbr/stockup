# StockUp
You don't need to be afraid of forgetting to buy things at the supermarket and having to go again just to buy the missing product. There's no need anymore to go around the place multiple times if you can organize your list by categories that define the sections of your preferred supermarket. StockUp is a versatile solution where you can create your own categories and products, keep track of the prices, and much more. All of this makes it very simple to control your household stock and purchase the products.

### Your list üìù
You have now a superpowered list on your hands. With that you can see all the products you usually purchase, set the ones that are missing, filter by categories and set price and quantity.
